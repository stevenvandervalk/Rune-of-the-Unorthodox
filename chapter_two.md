# Turn the Scotch into Two Knights

Scotch is good but it could be so much better.


## Ulvestad > your thing

Yes. It is true.


## let them eat cake


Playing the SChliemann is good for you. ivanchuk can do it. so can you

play the d5 variation even though it might be horrible because it might be saucy.

## if you have to improve the Mosquito

Theme: Qh4! 

Since the four knights variation is boring as shit.  See diagram below where white gets all the fun with bg5 after nf6 and if you want to chop BxNc3 it is even crappier...

We decided to take up the Malaniuk variation of the scotch!

If Nc3 then Qh4.  If NxN and Bd3 then Qh4!
